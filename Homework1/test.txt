I hate the idea of league of legends ending it's run as a great e-sport. I think it's going to happen at some point in time, and likley sooner than later, but at the same time, I think that it's doing ggereat as it is and it will think that it is safe, but in reality it will be broken to it's core and won't realize it untill it's too late.
